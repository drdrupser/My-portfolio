# Legacy Archive

This directory contains the original static portfolio files that were migrated from the single-page application to a full-stack architecture.

## Archived Files

- **index.html** - Original portfolio HTML page
- **stayle.css** - Original styling (note the typo in filename)
- **main.js** - Original JavaScript functionality

## Migration Details

These files were archived on: $(date)

**Reason for archiving:**
- Transitioned from static single-page portfolio to modern full-stack application
- Legacy files preserved for reference and potential future use
- New architecture includes React frontend and Node.js backend

## Legacy Structure

The original portfolio was a simple static site with:
- Single HTML page with hero, about, projects, services, contact, and footer sections
- Vanilla CSS for styling and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

## Future Considerations

If needed, these files could be:
1. Integrated as static assets in the new frontend
2. Used as reference for migrating content to React components
3. Completely removed once content is successfully migrated

For the new full-stack application, see the main README.md file.
